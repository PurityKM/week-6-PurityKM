# Week 6: Visualizing Your Expenses (Using March 2023 Data)

This week, we'll leverage the power of data visualization to gain insights from your personal expense data collected in March 2023. You'll build upon your understanding of choosing appropriate charts and apply them to your real-world data.

## Learning Objectives:

* Import expense data into a visualization tool (Microsoft Excel/ Google Sheets).
* Create bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent expense categories, trends, and proportions.
* Analyze visualizations to identify spending patterns and areas for potential optimization.

## Data:

You'll be working with a CSV file containing your expense data from March 2023 found in this repo. This data includes details like:

Date: Date of the expense
Time: Time of the expense (optional)
Category: Category of the expense (e.g., groceries, dining, transportation)
Amount: Amount spent

## Choosing a Data Visualization Tool:

**For this assignment, select a user-friendly data visualization tool based on your comfort level. Here are popular options:**

Spreadsheet software: Tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets offer built-in charting functionalities.
Online visualization tools: Explore various online options with user-friendly interfaces for creating charts and graphs.
Submission Instructions (Git):

## Instructions

1. Download the expense data (CSV file) in this repo, 
2. Open it in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
3. Transform the data so it can be readable then rename the file as an Excel sheet (.xlsx)
4. Perform the visualization tasks outlined below.
5. In another file create (summary.docx) and describe your findings and what have you learnt for each task below. 
6. Save and Upload the two documents (summary.docx & myExpenses.xlsx) onto this repo as your submission.

## Let's Get Visual!

In this assignment, we'll create three core visualizations to understand your spending habits in March 2023:

## Task 1: Total Expenses by Category (Bar Chart)

**With the data you imported myExpenses.xlsx**

Create a bar chart: Construct a bar chart with the following specifications:

X-axis: Category (e.g., groceries, dining, transportation)

Y-axis: Total amount spent for each category (Tip: You might need to calculate the total expense per category using functions offered by your tool)

Customize the chart: Add a clear title (e.g., "Total Expenses by Category - March 2023") and labels for both axes for readability.

Describe your chart in the document summary.docx

## Task 2: Expense Trends by Day (Line Graph)

Create a line graph: Construct a line graph with the following specifications:

X-axis: Day of the month (Ensure the data is grouped by day)

Y-axis: Total expenses for each day (You might need to group your data by day before plotting)

Analyze the graph: Look for any daily spending patterns. Are there specific days with consistently higher or lower expenses?

Describe your chart in the document summary.docx

## Task 3: Spending Proportions by Category (Pie Chart)

Create a pie chart: Construct a pie chart with the following specifications:

Slices: Expense categories

Values: Total expenses for each category (Tip: You can reuse the calculations from Task 1)

Analyze the pie chart: Identify the category that contributed the most to your overall spending in March 2023.

Describe your chart in the document summary.docx

## Remember these tips for effective visualization:

1. Clear Titles & Labels: Ensure your charts have clear titles and labels so viewers understand the data being presented.
2. Readable Colour Schemes: Use colour schemes that are easy to distinguish, avoiding confusing or visually overwhelming combinations.
3. Highlighting Key Findings: Draw attention to key insights revealed by the visualizations.

Practice Makes Perfect!

Experiment with different chart types and explore more advanced features offered by your chosen tool. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance as you create your visualizations.

Next Steps:

In the upcoming lessons, we'll delve deeper into advanced data analysis techniques, exploring additional chart types and functionalities to further enhance your data analysis skills.
